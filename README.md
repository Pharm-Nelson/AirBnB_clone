 first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

at the end of the project i was able to:
 create a Python package
 create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
 do  Unit testing and implement it in a large project
 serialize and deserialize a Class
 write and read a JSON file
  manage datetime
 Do  an UUID
know  *args and how to use it
**kwargs and how to use it
 handle named arguments in a function
